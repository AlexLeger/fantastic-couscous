OperatorFabric is a modular, extensible, industrial-strength and field-tested platform for use in electricity, water, and other utility operations.

* System visualization and console integration
* Precise alerting
* Workflow scheduling
* Historian
* Scripting (ex: Python, JavaScript)

It is an open source project initiated by http://www.rte-france.com/[RTE] with https://www.lfenergy.org/[LF Energy].

== What does OperatorFabric do in practice?

To perform their duties, an operator has to interact with multiple applications (perform actions, watch for alerts, etc.), which can prove difficult if there are too many of them.

The idea is to aggregate all the notifications from all these applications into a single screen, and to allow the operator to act on them if needed. 

These notifications are materialized by *cards* sorted in a *feed* according to their period of relevance and their severity.
When a card is selected in the feed, the right-hand pane displays the *details* of the card: information about the state of the parent process instance in the third-party application that published it, available actions, etc. 

In addition, the cards will also translate as events displayed on a *timeline* (its design is still under discussion) at the top of the screen.
This view will be complimentary to the card feed in that it will allow the operator to see at a glance the status of processes for a given period, when the feed is more like a "To Do" list.

image:feed_details_1.png[Feed screen layout]

Part of the value of OperatorFabric is that it makes the integration very simple on the part of the third-party applications.
To start publishing cards to users in an OperatorFabric instance, all they have to do is:
* Register as a publisher through the "Thirds" service and provide a "bundle" containing handlebars templates defining how cards should be rendered, i18n info etc.
* Publish cards as json containing card data through the card publication API

OperatorFabric will then:
* Dispatch the cards to the appropriate users (by computing the actual users who should receive the card from the recipients rules defined in the card)
* Take care of the rendering of the cards, displaying details, actions, inputs etc.
* Display relevant information from the cards in the timeline

Another aim of OperatorFabric is to make cooperation easier by letting operators forward or send cards to other operators, for example:
* If they need an input from another operator
* If they can't handle a given card for lack of time or because the necessary action is out of their scope

This will replace phone calls or emails, making cooperation more efficient and traceable.

For instance, operators might be interested in knowing why a given decision was made in the past:
the cards detailing the decision process steps will be accessible through the Archives screen, showing how the
operators reached this agreement.

== Licensing

This project and all its subproject are licensed under https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/[Mozilla Public License V2.0]. See link:LICENSE.txt[LICENSE.txt]

== Requirements

=== Tools and libraries

* Gradle 5 +
* Java 8.0.163-zulu +
* maven 3.5.3 +
* Docker
* Docker Compose with 2.1+ file format support
* Chrome (needed for UI tests in build)

Note: Java 8.0.163-zulu is no longer available for security reasons, the next version is Java 8.0.192-zulu.

=== Browser support

//Todo add browser support info



It is highly recommended to use sdkman (https://sdkman.io/[sdkman.io]) and
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage tools versions.
By *sourcing* bin/load_environment_light.sh which uses sdkman and nvm you can set
up a whole environment with gradle, java, maven and project variable set.

==== Software

* link:RABBITMQ.md[RabbitMQ 3.7.6 +]: AMQP messaging layer allows inter service communication
* MongoDB 4.0 +: Card persistent storage

RabbitMQ is required for :

* Time change push
* Card AMQP push
* Multiple service sync

MongoDB is required for :

* Current Card storage
* Archived Card storage
* User Storage

preconfigured mongo and rabbitmq are available in the form of docker-compose configuration file at
link:src/main/docker[src/main/docker]

=== Prerequisites

Before running containers with docker-compose, it is required to configure a docker network for them
`
docker network create opfabnet
`
You can also use the bin/setup_dockerized_environment which builds the services images ant sets up the opfabnet ntework

=== Projects structures and configurations

Projects must conforms to a few rules in order for the configured tasks to work

==== Java

* [sub-project]/src/main/java : contains java source code
* [sub-project]/src/test/java : contains java tests source code
* [sub-project]/src/main/resources : contains resource files
* [sub-project]/src/test/resources : contains test resource files

==== Modeling

Core services projects declaring REST APIS uses swagger for their definition must declare txo files :

* *[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml*: swagger api definition ;
* *[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/config.json*: swagger generator configuration.

==== Docker

Services project all have docker image generated in their build cycle (See gradle tasks).

Per project configuration :

* docker file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/Dockerfile*
* docker-compose file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml*
* runtime data : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/volume* is copied to
*[sub-project]/build/docker-volume/* by task *copyWorkingDir*. The latest
can then be mounted as volume in docker containers.

== 4. Docker demo

Demoable global docker compose files are available at :

* [root]/src/main/docker/demo : sets up all services, generate a dummy card every 5 seconds
* [root]/src/main/docker/deploy : sets up all services, ready for card reception

*This demo setup exposes the application UI at localhost:2002/ui/*

*NOTE:* Don't forget the *final slash* in the URL or you will get an error.

Card publication entry points are exposed at localhost:2102/cards

For debugging purpose the following ports are also exposed :

== 8. Recipes

=== Generating docker images

To Generate all docker images run `bin/setup_dockerized_environment`,
it will generate all images and also generate an opfabnet docker network

NB: if you work behind a proxy you need to specify the following properties to
configure alpine apk package manager :

* apk.proxy.uri: proxy http uri ex: "http://somewhere:3128[http://somewhere:3128]" (defaults to blank)
* apk.proxy.httpsuri: proxy http uri ex: "http://somewhere:3128[http://somewhere:3128]" (defaults to apk.proxy.uri value)
* apk.proxy.user: proxy user
* apk.proxy.password: proxy *unescaped* password

Alternatively, you may configure the following environment variables :

* APK_PROXY_URI
* APK_PROXY_HTTPS_URI
* APK_PROXY_USER
* APK_PROXY_PASSWORD

=== Managing a service with docker-compose

Prerequisites : images must be registred

* To deploy a service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeUp`
example for the third-party-service service :
`
gradle :services:core:third-party-service:composeUp
`
* To tear down a service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeDown`
* To start an already containerized service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeStart`
* To stop an already containerized service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeStop`
* To follow logs of a running service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeLog`

=== Running subproject from jar file

* gradle :[sub-projectPath]:bootJar
* or java -jar [sub-projectPath]/build/libs/[sub-project].jar

=== Overriding properties when running from jar file

* java -jar [sub-projectPath]/build/libs/[sub-project].jar –spring.config.additional-location=file:[filepath]
NB : properties may be set using ".properties" file or ".yml" file. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Spring Boot configuration] for more info.
* Generic property list extract :
** server.port (defaults to 8080) : embedded server port
* :services:core:third-party-service properties list extract :
** thirds.storage.path (defaults to &quot;&quot;) : where to save/load OperatorFabric Third Party data

=== Service port table

By default all service built artifacts are configured with server.port set to 8080

If you run the services using `bootRun` gradle task or the provided docker-compose files (see [prj]/src/main/docker) the ports used are

[cols="<,>,>,>"]
